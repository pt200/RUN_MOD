ANSI/VT100 Terminal Control Escape Sequences

[ Status | Setup | Fonts | Cursor | Scrolling | Tabs | Erasing | Printing | Keyboard | Colours ]

Many computer terminals and terminal emulators support colour and cursor control through a system of escape sequences. One such standard is commonly referred to as ANSI Colour. Several terminal specifications are based on the ANSI colour standard, including VT100.

The following is a partial listing of the VT100 control set.

<ESC> represents the ASCII "escape" character, 0x1B. Bracketed tags represent modifiable decimal parameters; eg. {ROW} would be replaced by a row number.

Device Status

The following codes are used for reporting terminal/display settings, and vary depending on the implementation:
Query Device Code	<ESC>[c
Requests a Report Device Code response from the device.
Report Device Code	<ESC>[{code}0c
Generated by the device in response to Query Device Code request.
Query Device Status	<ESC>[5n
Requests a Report Device Status response from the device.
Report Device OK	<ESC>[0n
Generated by the device in response to a Query Device Status request; indicates that device is functioning correctly.
Report Device Failure	<ESC>[3n
Generated by the device in response to a Query Device Status request; indicates that device is functioning improperly.
Query Cursor Position	<ESC>[6n
Requests a Report Cursor Position response from the device.
Report Cursor Position	<ESC>[{ROW};{COLUMN}R
Generated by the device in response to a Query Cursor Position request; reports current cursor position.
Terminal Setup

The h and l codes are used for setting terminal/display mode, and vary depending on the implementation. Line Wrap is one of the few setup codes that tend to be used consistently:
Reset Device		<ESC>c
Reset all terminal settings to default.
Enable Line Wrap	<ESC>[7h
Text wraps to next line if longer than the length of the display area.
Disable Line Wrap	<ESC>[7l
Disables line wrapping.
Fonts

Some terminals support multiple fonts: normal/bold, swiss/italic, etc. There are a variety of special codes for certain terminals; the following are fairly standard:
Font Set G0		<ESC>(
Set default font.
Font Set G1		<ESC>)
Set alternate font.
Cursor Control

Cursor Home 		<ESC>[{ROW};{COLUMN}H
Sets the cursor position where subsequent text will begin. If no row/column parameters are provided (ie. <ESC>[H), the cursor will move to the home position, at the upper left of the screen.
Cursor Up		<ESC>[{COUNT}A
Moves the cursor up by COUNT rows; the default count is 1.
Cursor Down		<ESC>[{COUNT}B
Moves the cursor down by COUNT rows; the default count is 1.
Cursor Forward		<ESC>[{COUNT}C
Moves the cursor forward by COUNT columns; the default count is 1.
Cursor Backward		<ESC>[{COUNT}D
Moves the cursor backward by COUNT columns; the default count is 1.
Force Cursor Position	<ESC>[{ROW};{COLUMN}f
Identical to Cursor Home.
Save Cursor		<ESC>[s
Save current cursor position.
Unsave Cursor		<ESC>[u
Restores cursor position after a Save Cursor.
Save Cursor & Attrs	<ESC>7
Save current cursor position.
Restore Cursor & Attrs	<ESC>8
Restores cursor position after a Save Cursor.
Scrolling

Scroll Screen		<ESC>[r
Enable scrolling for entire display.
Scroll Screen		<ESC>[{start};{end}r
Enable scrolling from row {start} to row {end}.
Scroll Down		<ESC>D
Scroll display down one line.
Scroll Up		<ESC>M
Scroll display up one line.
Tab Control

Set Tab 		<ESC>H
Sets a tab at the current position.
Clear Tab 		<ESC>[g
Clears tab at the current position.
Clear All Tabs 		<ESC>[3g
Clears all tabs.
Erasing Text

Erase End of Line	<ESC>[K
Erases from the current cursor position to the end of the current line.
Erase Start of Line	<ESC>[1K
Erases from the current cursor position to the start of the current line.
Erase Line		<ESC>[2K
Erases the entire current line.
Erase Down		<ESC>[J
Erases the screen from the current line down to the bottom of the screen.
Erase Up		<ESC>[1J
Erases the screen from the current line up to the top of the screen.
Erase Screen		<ESC>[2J
Erases the screen with the background colour and moves the cursor to home.
Printing

Some terminals support local printing:
Print Screen		<ESC>[i
Print the current screen.
Print Line		<ESC>[1i
Print the current line.
Stop Print Log		<ESC>[4i
Disable log.
Start Print Log		<ESC>[5i
Start log; all received text is echoed to a printer.
Define Key

Set Key Definition	<ESC>[{key};"{string}"p
Associates a string of text to a keyboard key. {key} indicates the key by its ASCII value in decimal.
Set Display Attributes

Set Attribute Mode	<ESC>[{attr1};...;{attrn}m
Sets multiple display attribute settings. The following lists standard attributes:
0	Reset all attributes
1	Bright
2	Dim
4	Underscore	
5	Blink
7	Reverse
8	Hidden

	Foreground Colours
